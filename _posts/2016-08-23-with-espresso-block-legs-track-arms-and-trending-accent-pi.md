  place in your living room or guest room. Featuring clean cuts and immaculate
  lines, this sofa has a traditional style that is hard to miss. You can pair

  independently-wrapped pocket coil spring system, which makes the sofa
  comfortable while sitting for a long time. It has a reclining feature, which
  pushes the back up to 180 degrees, making it a flat and full-sized bed. This
  sofa stands on four wooden legs, which have a dark brown finish. It can easily
  seat three people and has a weight capacity of 600 pounds.
