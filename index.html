</picture><p>With espresso block legs, track arms, and trending accent pillows, the Convert-a-CouchÂ® Athena Convertible Sofa sets the scene in any living space. Five upholstery options blend easily with every color scheme, and the versatile silhouette converts into
    a full-sized sleeper for overnight guests. Simple yet highly practical, the Athena Convertible Sofa is a great option to place in your living room or guest room. Featuring clean cuts and immaculate lines, this sofa has a traditional style that is
    hard to miss. You can pair this sofa with matching accent chairs to create a lovely set for your main drawing room or family room. Occupying very little floor space, this sofa proves to be a convenient option to use in dormitories, hostel rooms, or
    rooms with a confined floor area. The Athena Convertible Sofa from Mercury Row is made from premium-quality foam filling, which has a thick density of 1.8 cubic feet. It is upholstered in high-quality polyester for unmatched durability. This sofa
    is available in a range of solid upholstery colors, which can be chosen in accordance with the color scheme or decor of your room. It has an independently-wrapped pocket coil spring system, which makes the sofa comfortable while sitting for a long
    time. It has a reclining feature, which pushes the back up to 180 degrees, making it a flat and full-sized bed. This sofa stands on four wooden legs, which have a dark brown finish. It can easily seat three people and has a weight capacity of 600
    pounds.</p><p>Features</p><p>Converts to a full size bed</p><p>This sofa is more like a futon and does not have a pull out mattress</p><p>Storage beneath included: No</p><p>Compatible with higher legs: No</p><p>Material: 100% Polyester Linen</p><p>Foam and cover include fire retardants</p><p>Athena collection</p><p>Leg finish: Espresso</p><p>576 Independently wrapped pocket coil spring system</p><p>No bar in the back for added sleeping comfort</p><p>10" Pillow top seat cushion for extra comfort</p><p>Back folds down to create full-size bed</p><p>Top seat cushion</p><p>Product Details</p><p>Design: Convertible</p><p>Upholstery Material: Microfiber</p><p>Assembly Required: Yes</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="28"><!-- react-empty: 29 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-6564316b-3eb3-4512-ba37-5c83ac895621" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="30"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="31"><picture>
